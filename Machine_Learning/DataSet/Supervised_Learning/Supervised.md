***Supervised Learning: Learning from Labeled Data***

You keep learning this again and again. In the exam, when you see a picture, you can say:

"This is a dog" or "This is a cat"

👉 ***You already know the correct answers while learning.***

That's why it is called ***supervised learning***:

***Input*** is given (image, number, text)

***Correct output (label)*** is also given

You learn and then predict

***Common Supervised Algorithms***

***Linear Regression***
Used to predict numbers (price, marks, salary)

***Logistic Regression***
Used to predict categories like: Yes / No, Spam / Not Spam, Pass / Fail

***Decision Trees 🌳***
Works like a 20 Questions game (Yes/No questions)

***Support Vector Machine (SVM)***
Draws a line to separate things clearly

***Simple Supervised ML Problem Example***

***Problem:*** Predict if a student will pass or fail.

***Input (Features):***
- Hours studied
- Attendance percentage

***Output (Label):***
- Pass ✅
- Fail ❌

Here, we already know past students' results, so we train the model using them.
